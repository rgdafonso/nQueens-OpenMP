# nQueens-OpenMP
This algorithm solves the nQueens problem an it was made in introduction to parallel programming course.

NQueens is a probleme where you have to place n queens in a chess board in a way they can't atack each other.

OpenMP is an API used to introduce parallel programming to this algorithm in order to make it faster. 

This is my solution, probabbly far from being the best solution but this is how I made it.
